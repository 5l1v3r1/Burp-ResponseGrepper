Burp extension to auto-extract values from responses based on a regular expression. 
Extracts the match and any named or unnamed groups. A bit like Burp Intruder's "Grep - Extract" option, but should work on any responses. 

Regex is defined per-request.

TODO: hide the tab from Target, Search, etc.

This is a Python extension, so it needs jython to be configured.
